# Bouncing balls

## Description
I reformatted my very first hobby project I did during my first programming course, a 2D simulation of colliding balls. The balls obey physical law apart from angular momentum and friction. As a result the balls behave strange when they are stacked on top of each other.

## How to run
 - Compile & execute
```
$ javac BouncingBalls.java && java BouncingBalls
```
 - Press left mouse button to add a ball and right mouse button to remove all balls.
